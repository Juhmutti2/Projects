Contains two files, source code for investment return calculator and executable file. Files are in finnish as they use finnish tax rates. Inspiration for my first ever project was the notion that there arent good finnish calculators which take taxes into account. So far calculator can be used for capital return taxes and dividend return taxes. Maybe in the future I'll add option to calculate taxes and profits from unlisted companies. So if software is in finnish why an english readme? Very good question :D
