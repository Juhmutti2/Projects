Hey!

Are you like me, always wanting to know if there is something more to Python? Worry no more! I have a program to satisfy your needs.  

Every_fuction.py lists every fuction Python has to offer. It is limited though, you must choose which modules you want to print. But then again it is likely you wont want every function info at a given time. 

To run the program:

1. download every_function.py
2. save it to a desired folder
3. run code with code editor
3.1 Run code with command prompt: open commandprompt by typing "cmd" into address bar. This opens command promt directly into current folder. Type "python every_function.py" without "" -marks. 
3.2 Copy pasting to code editor Works too. 


Using the Program:

-Choose 1 to print out every module in Python. 
-Choose 2 to print out built-in functions of Python. This means function Python has when no additional modules are imported. Additional modules means for example math and numpy. 
-Choose 3 to print out help() for every module on user input. For example "sqlite3 pygame random". Run without ""-marks. input is not case sensitive.
